# What is this

This is a personal used zsh theme, a reversion from [Jonathan](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/jonathan.zsh-theme) in [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh). It did modification mainly on the layout and color of Jonathan, shifted the main color from cyan to grey, and move information to location more used to me personally.

I will appreciate it that you like this modification. This project follows MIT Licence as what Oh-My-Zsh follows. If there is any license violation I did not notice, please contact me.
